# Stage 1
make intermediate struct that allows opening ( Dir / documents / normal files ) and allows you to convert into markdown / HTML

# Stage 2
allow converting HTML to image using wkhtmltox (should be go side imo)

# Stage 3
add normal images into the mix, also also resizing and filtering

# Stage 4
allow converting into inline images and make that default behavior
